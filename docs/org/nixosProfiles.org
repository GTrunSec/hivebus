#+RESULTS:
GVFS stands for Gnome Virtual File System, which is a service that provides a virtual file system for the GNOME desktop environment. It allows users to access remote file systems, browse and mount disks, manage files, and perform other file-related operations. In NixOS, services.gvfs enables GVFS in the desktop environment, allowing users to access remote file systems and perform other file-related operations.
services.gvfs is a component in the NixOS operating system that allows the system to interact with various file systems such as USB drives, CD/DVD drives, and remote file systems using the Gnome Virtual File System (GVFS) technology. GVFS provides a layer between the operating system and the file systems, allowing for automatic mounting and unmounting of devices and enabling users to browse and access files on remote servers over various protocols like FTP, SMB, SSH, etc. The services.gvfs module is responsible for managing this functionality in NixOS.
